# Lost-Found-Application
The Community Lost and Found Application is all about making  it  easier  for  people  in    a  community to report and find lost items. The idea is to bring together those who mightâ€™ve lost  something with those who come across it, creating a smoother, more connected experience in  recovering lost belongings.
